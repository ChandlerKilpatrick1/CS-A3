The Foothill Honor Code States: 
The two most common kinds of academic dishonesty are cheating and plagiarism.

Cheating is the act of obtaining or attempting to obtain credit for academic work through the use of dishonest, deceptive or fraudulent means. 
Plagiarism is representing the work of someone else as your own and submitting it for any purpose.
